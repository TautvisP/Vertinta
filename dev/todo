+ when agency is editing evaluator account, the header changes

+ Some views still have the old login logic, need to adapt it to the new one with login mixins

+ make so that order_list displays only that users orders

+ header still covers content, maybe there are issues with some of the templates, maybe they lack some sort of css styles to adapt the header. Some of the templates that the header covers the content: edit_evaluator_account, edit_agency_account, order_list

unregistered users should be able to select what object they want to evaluate

when adding an additional object, the user should be able to add more than one, and have a seperate button for going to the next step, now after adding a single garage, the next step is loaded. Also make it so that when editing a user can change the type of the building.

+ after agency_select the user gets redirected to the login page instead of order list

+ possibly header styling is messed up, since after removing it some pages react differently, some with the added link to the header do not print their content

+ agency_select window incorrectly calculates evaluator count

+ allow agency to change order evaluator

+ Fix evaluator/forms.py with correct input fields and enums, make it so that the first step of evaluating an order consists of many different templates with at most 2 forms populated with order data.

+ If I change the forms in order/forms.py from forms.Form to forms.ModelForm, the users editOrder throws errors while the evaluator edit order is fine.

Input fields should have validation checks and display what information has been inputed incorrectly

+ Complete gallery logic, in models.py add comment and category fields, enums. Make migration.

Back button in image_annotation is in the wrong place, need to fix styling

+ Uploaded images are possibly not getting ignored by .gitignore. Need to change the name of the folder

add build type to house object form; object type kita should have COMERCIAL_CHOICES for purpose; house type shouldnt have selection for land purpose type, but for house type. Add FLOOR_COUNT_CHOICES to house type.

+ Similar object search for some reason doesnt get the object type in post method

+ Similar object addition should use evaluation first step forms and views, need to adapt their logic to check if the object is an additional one and correct saving to database

+ Need to remove if else statement for saving regular object in similar object addition. Also need to add if statement to tempaltes, because navigation buttons are meant for original object

+ When adding a new similar object, the forms get populated with data from the previously added object when they shouldn't. edit_object.html navigation buttons point to incorrect links.

+ Add an if statement to templates for progress bar showing.

+ Need to check with mentor, but possibly would be a good idea to seperate evaluator view into a couple of views

+ In AgencySelectionView the appraiser_with_least_orders function doesnt seem to be working, possibly the evaluator order fields are not saved in the database.

+ Make constant context['total_steps'] = 8

+ In gallery different images have different sizes, also need to test what would happen if i upload an image named the same as an already existing one. Image deletion doesnt seem to work. Also need to fix styling.

+ Add footer with company logo

+ If user enters new object data and leaves the creation page without completing all the steps, he cannot continue creating the new order, cant add additional objects, cant select agency.

Fix responsive design

+ Would be a good idea to have some sort of list for added additional files for the object, so the evaluator would be able to remove or edit added files and their content.

+ When a user is editing his account, seperate the account data and password change forms. Its annoying to enter your password 3 times to change the name.

+ Agency cant see evaluators orders.

+ When evaluator goes into annotation, then presses "Atgal", then presses "Pirmyn", an error occurs, but if he presses "Pirmyn" without going to annotate, everything workds fine.

Need to check every views permission, because now if im logged in as agency and go into evaluator specific url (http://127.0.0.1:8000/evaluator/evaluation_steps/19/), I can fully edit the order and do other tasks without being prompted to log in. Permissions are messed up.

Additional documents should be converted to pdf, the final report to latex and then to pdf, as the last step of the final report generation, combine additional documents with the final one using linux built in commands (pdftk, imagemagic) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2507766/merge-convert-multiple-pdf-files-into-one-pdf

+ Need to further implement document addition, since the conversion from odt to pdf doesnt keep the formatting, and most other approaches I've tested do not work. Currently .txt to .pdf seems to work fine, .odt to .pdf doesnt keep the formatting (new lines and tabulations), .docx to .pdf isnt tested yet. Also need to test with pictures, tables and other more difficult scenarios in the files. IDEA: maybe upload original documents content as pictures to pdf?

should use css instead of .csv: https://fontawesome.com/icons/categories/coding

for nicer forms: https://nielsvoogt.github.io/nice-forms.css/

Need to test nearby organization coordinate copy button on different OS and browsers.

+ Need to fix nearby organization addition, add a check for duplicates in list, translate category with CATEGORY_CHOICES enum, also need to add the ability for the user to manually add nearby organizations.

+ Need to add viewing of data functionality, because now it is combined with editing. If the user is only viewing, more information could be displayed on the screen.

Need to make warning and success messages to the standards of codex/osom. Also make a warning message if an object exists in add_nearby_organization. Sometimes in found_organizations, multiple errors stack: """Organization added successfully. Organization already exists in the database. Organization already exists in the database. Organization already exists in the database."""

Would be a good idea to have a help page (or a quesntion mark which after pressed would bring up a pop up with info) for the more intricate input fields. Or an info page that would provide with general information(link to https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/TAIS.82185)

+ Wouble be nice to have a check at the report generation, which would warn the evaluator if theres specific data missing that the report needs.

An apartament can have a basement. Pamatai for apartament is irrelivant

+ Should have the ability to delete or edit an annotation. Fix annotation modal size, because different size images change the size of the modal.

+ / - Need to fix image annotation display in latex. Useful links below:

Need to fix header, in some windows it starts at the top left corner, while in some it is closer to the middle of the screen. Possibly because some templates extend a template with bootstrap.

+ Add counter for how many current projects, and completed evaluations each evaluator and agency has.

+ Missing values in report: house_number or flat_number; building_floor_count, floor; interior_deco, interior_floors, ceiling_deco; garage_size, garage_cars_count; shed_size, shed_type; gazebo_size, gazebo_type, gazebo_electricity; object_type; evaluation_info.

Would benefit from adding additional information that would specify some data. For example: gazebo/shed/garage accurate sizes (length, width, height). Order creation date.

Add comment section in order for user.

admin page, use default django admin panel with different skins.

+ http://127.0.0.1:8000/evaluator/evaluation_steps/24/edit_similar_object_data/50/ 'EditSimilarObjectDataView' object has no attribute 'render_to_response'

+ Agency select evaluator count is still random

+ When user is creating an order and doesnt select the agency, there is no way to continue selecting it after he leaves the window.

Need to think of a logical solution to register agency and evaluator role users, maybe have a button. Maybe add invitation logic, similar to password change. Have the token in url. Agency invites evaluator, admin invites agency through admin panel. https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html

+ permissions have been fixed in agency view, tested with evaluator and regular user. Make it so that orders can only be edited or deleted by the parties involved with that order, not with any random user.

Warning messages (for example you do not have permission to access this page) only appear when the user logs out in the log in form. Need to make mesasges appear in the appropriate windows.

remove api path from annotations.

need to look into pandoc, because now two versions of them are present in the project.

in found organization the error message is barelly visible and in an incorrect language.

Similar object form is now meant for houses, not for apartaments?
