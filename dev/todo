+ when agency is editing evaluator account, the header changes

+ Some views still have the old login logic, need to adapt it to the new one with login mixins

+ make so that order_list displays only that users orders

+ header still covers content, maybe there are issues with some of the templates, maybe they lack some sort of css styles to adapt the header. Some of the templates that the header covers the content: edit_evaluator_account, edit_agency_account, order_list

unregistered users should be able to select what object they want to evaluate

when adding an additional object, the user should be able to add more than one, and have a seperate button for going to the next step, now after adding a single garage, the next step is loaded. Also make it so that when editing a user can change the type of the building.

after agency_select the user gets redirected to the login page instead of order list

+ possibly header styling is messed up, since after removing it some pages react differently, some with the added link to the header do not print their content

agency_select window incorrectly calculates evaluator count

allow agency to change order evaluator

+ Fix evaluator/forms.py with correct input fields and enums, make it so that the first step of evaluating an order consists of many different templates with at most 2 forms populated with order data.

+ If I change the forms in order/forms.py from forms.Form to forms.ModelForm, the users editOrder throws errors while the evaluator edit order is fine.

Input fields should have validation checks and display what information has been inputed incorrectly

+ Complete gallery logic, in models.py add comment and category fields, enums. Make migration.

Back button in image_annotation is in the wrong place, need to fix styling

+ Uploaded images are possibly not getting ignored by .gitignore. Need to change the name of the folder

add build type to house object form; object type kita should have COMERCIAL_CHOICES for purpose; house type shouldnt have selection for land purpose type, but for house type. Add FLOOR_COUNT_CHOICES to house type.

+ Similar object search for some reason doesnt get the object type in post method

+ Similar object addition should use evaluation first step forms and views, need to adapt their logic to check if the object is an additional one and correct saving to database

+ Need to remove if else statement for saving regular object in similar object addition. Also need to add if statement to tempaltes, because navigation buttons are meant for original object

+ When adding a new similar object, the forms get populated with data from the previously added object when they shouldn't. edit_object.html navigation buttons point to incorrect links.

+ Add an if statement to templates for progress bar showing.

+ Need to check with mentor, but possibly would be a good idea to seperate evaluator view into a couple of views

In AgencySelectionView the appraiser_with_least_orders function doesnt seem to be working, possibly the evaluator order fields are not saved in the database.

+ Make constant context['total_steps'] = 8

+ In gallery different images have different sizes, also need to test what would happen if i upload an image named the same as an already existing one. Image deletion doesnt seem to work. Also need to fix styling.

+ Add footer with company logo

+ If user enters new object data and leaves the creation page without completing all the steps, he cannot continue creating the new order, cant add additional objects, cant select agency.

Fix responsive design

Would be a good idea to have some sort of list for added additional files for the object, so the evaluator would be able to remove or edit added files and their content.

Need to test document addition with a .docx file.

When uploading a .odt file, its formatting doesnt seem to be getting extracted, needs further tweaking.

+ When a user is editing his account, seperate the account data and password change forms. Its annoying to enter your password 3 times to change the name.

+ Agency cant see evaluators orders.

+ When evaluator goes into annotation, then presses "Atgal", then presses "Pirmyn", an error occurs, but if he presses "Pirmyn" without going to annotate, everything workds fine.

Need to further implement document addition, since the conversion from odt to pdf doesnt keep the formatting, and most other approaches I've tested do not work. Currently .txt to .pdf seems to work fine, .odt to .pdf doesnt keep the formatting (new lines and tabulations), .docx to .pdf isnt tested yet. Also need to test with pictures, tables and other more difficult scenarios in the files. IDEA: maybe upload original documents content as pictures to pdf?

Need to check every views permission, because now if im logged in as agency and go into evaluator specific url (http://127.0.0.1:8000/evaluator/evaluation_steps/19/), I can fully edit the order and do other tasks without being prompted to log in. Permissions are messed up.
