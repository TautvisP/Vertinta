+ when agency is editing evaluator account, the header changes

+ Some views still have the old login logic, need to adapt it to the new one with login mixins

+ make so that order_list displays only that users orders

header still covers content, maybe there are issues with some of the templates, maybe they lack some sort of css styles to adapt the header. Some of the templates that the header covers the content: edit_evaluator_account, edit_agency_account, order_list

unregistered users should be able to select what object they want to evaluate

when adding an additional object, the user should be able to add more than one, and have a seperate button for going to the next step, now after adding a single garage, the next step is loaded. Also make it so that when editing a user can change the type of the building.

after agency_select the user gets redirected to the login page instead of order list

+ possibly header styling is messed up, since after removing it some pages react differently, some with the added link to the header do not print their content

agency_select window incorrectly calculates evaluator count

allow agency to change order evaluator

+ Fix evaluator/forms.py with correct input fields and enums, make it so that the first step of evaluating an order consists of many different templates with at most 2 forms populated with order data.

+ If i change the forms in order/forms.py from forms.Form to forms.ModelForm, the users editOrder throws errors while the evaluator edit order is fine.

Input fields should have validation checks and display what information has been inputed incorrectly

Complete gallery logic, in models.py add comment and category fields, enums. Make migration.

Back button in image_annotation is in the wrong place, need to fix styling
